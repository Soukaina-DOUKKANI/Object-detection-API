# Object-detection-API
This project is part of the field of deep learning, neural networks and computer vision.
it is about building an API of object detection using the algorithm YOLO and OpenCV, 
detecting licence plate of a car using computer vision modules and detecting the content of licence plate using python library (pytesseract) and Tesseract-OCR. 


Deployment: we have deployed the API on Ubuntu VPS 18.04 LTS. 

Please find in the PDF file 'API deployment' the steps envolved in the deployment task.

Frameworks: pycharm, VScode.

Programming language: python . packages : numpy, pytesseract,flask, Opencv (version 4.4.0.42)
